# MyCards
MyCards is an SRS app, allowing a user to create, manage, and use flash cards to learn various subjects.  The driving quality of MyCards is its use of notifications; a series of cards is selected, and at a pre-selected time a system notification reminds the user to drill themselves.

This app was designed and created by Bri O'Neil and Mike D'Arcy as a semester project for the spring 2017 section of CIS 470 (mobile application development) at Cleveland State University.
